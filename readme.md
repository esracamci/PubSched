This is a quick way to search PubMed for recent publications.

Search parameters are defined by a text file (names.txt) and reldate.

	(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25499/">reldate:</a> When reldate is set to an integer n, the search returns only those items that have a date specified by datetype within the last n days.)

## To run

1. Download files
2. Edit names.txt to contain the names of your labmates, collaborators, or other scientists.
