## pubmed7
This is a quick way to use python to search PubMed for recent publications by a list of authors. It's most useful as part of a larger tool, PubSched. 

Search parameters are defined by a text file (names.txt) and reldate.

> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25499/">reldate:</a> When reldate is set to an integer n, the search returns only those items that have a date specified by datetype within the last n days.

## To run

1. Download files.
2. Edit names.txt to contain the names of your labmates, collaborators, or other scientists.
3. Open your terminal and point it to the directory containing the files.
4. Run the code:
```python pubmed7.py'''
